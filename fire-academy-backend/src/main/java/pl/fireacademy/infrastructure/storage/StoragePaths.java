/**
 * What a folder and a filename are allowed to look like anywhere under the storage root.
 * <p>
 * Every stored name is minted by {@link LocalFileStorageService#storeImage} as a random UUID plus an
 * extension, and every name read back comes from a database column that was filled that way. So this
 * is not a filter over hostile input today — it is the layer that decides what happens on the day a
 * name arrives from somewhere else. Without it, {@code root.resolve(folder).resolve(filename)} will
 * happily walk out of the storage root on a name containing {@code ..}, and nothing between the
 * request and the filesystem would object.
 * <p>
 * The patterns live here rather than in each caller because there are two callers with the same
 * rule and different jobs: {@code FileController} turns a bad name into 400 before it reaches
 * storage, and {@link LocalFileStorageService} refuses it outright. Two copies of one security rule
 * drift, and the copy that falls behind is the one nobody is looking at.
