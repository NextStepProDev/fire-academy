     * Byte size says nothing about decode cost: a heavily compressed 1 MB JPEG can describe a
     * 12000x12000 image, and {@code ImageIO.read} would then allocate roughly 4 bytes per pixel —
     * ~576 MB inside a container capped at 384 MB. One request would be enough to get the backend
     * OOM-killed. The header carries the dimensions, so the size can be settled without decoding.
     * <p>
     * The number is arithmetic, not taste. The heap is 55% of a 384 MB container, so ~211 MB; at
     * 4 bytes a pixel this cap costs ~96 MB for the decoded image, plus the source bytes (≤10 MB)
     * and the encoder's output. That fits with the rest of the application still running — and only
     * because {@link #decodePermits} guarantees it is paid once at a time. The two belong together:
     * the previous 40 MPx allowed ~160 MB per request, so a single upload took most of the heap and
     * two concurrent ones ended the process (the JVM runs with {@code ExitOnOutOfMemoryError}).
     * <p>
     * 24 MPx is 6000×4000 — a full-frame camera export passes, a phone photo passes several times
     * over. Anything above that is not a picture somebody wanted to show, it is a picture somebody
     * wanted us to decode.

     * (the limiter allows twelve a minute per address, and a person changes their avatar or attaches
     * a watch screenshot in seconds), so serialising them costs nothing anybody will notice, and it
     * turns the heap budget above from an average into a guarantee.
     * <p>
     * Fair queueing so a steady stream of uploads cannot starve one straggler. The wait is short on
     * purpose: requests waiting here are cheap (their bytes are still in Tomcat's temp file, not on
     * the heap), but a queue that never gives up is its own way of falling over.
