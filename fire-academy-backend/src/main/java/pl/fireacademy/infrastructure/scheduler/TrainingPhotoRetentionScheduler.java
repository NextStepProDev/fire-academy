/**
 * Nightly trigger for the training photo passes. Holds the schedule and nothing else.
 * <p>
 * The work itself lives in {@link TrainingPhotoRetentionService} deliberately. Both passes are
 * transactional, and a transaction only exists when a call arrives through Spring's proxy — a pass
 * kept here and invoked from {@code sweep()} would be a plain call on {@code this}, running with the
 * annotation quietly doing nothing. Keeping the work in another bean removes the possibility rather
 * than leaving it as something to remember.
