/**
 * A shared point for sending HTML emails with retries (best-effort). Called from the {@code @Async}
 * methods of the mail services, so the retry loop runs on the {@code mailExecutor} pool thread and does not block
 * the user's request.
 * <p>
 * Transient SMTP errors (a brief Gmail unavailability, network) are the most common — a few spaced-out attempts
 * catch most of them. After the attempts are exhausted the email is dropped, but logged at ERROR level with a fixed
 * marker {@code MAIL_DELIVERY_FAILED}, so it can be caught in logs/monitoring. The method never
 * throws — sending an email must not break the business operation (the enrollment is already saved anyway).
