/**
 * "Last time this viewer looked at this calendar, and how far into it they got."
 * <p>
 * The client is the row where {@code userId == athleteId}; a coach gets one row per client, so two
 * admins keep independent counters. A missing row means EPOCH — count everything, which is the right
 * answer for a calendar nobody has opened yet.
 * <p>
 * Two columns rather than one, because being caught up has two edges. {@code seenAt} answers "as of
 * when", {@code seenThrough} answers "up to which day" — and without the second, opening one week
 * cleared the notice for a month the viewer never reached. It only ever moves forward: paging back
 * to last week cannot un-read what was already read.
