     *   <li>{@code seenAt} comes from the JVM clock, not SQL {@code now()}. Postgres {@code now()} is
     *       the transaction start time, which can predate activity written moments earlier and would
     *       freeze the counter at a stale value.</li>
     *   <li>{@code seenThrough} only ever moves FORWARD. Paging back to last week must not un-read a
     *       month already read, so the greater of the stored and incoming value wins. GREATEST
     *       ignores nulls, which is what carries rows written before this column existed.</li>
     *   <li>{@code clearAutomatically} — without it Hibernate keeps serving the old marker from its
     *       identity map for the rest of the transaction.</li>

     * sits beyond the last day they reached — the badge must not count anything the calendar cannot
     * show, and must not stop counting something the viewer never got to. Deletions are the one
     * source without that second clause: they reach the screen through the banner, which is not
     * bounded by the page at all.
     * <p>
     * The seen marker differs per athlete, which is why this cannot be a simple {@code IN} count:
     * each row has to be compared against that viewer's own marker for that athlete. The LEFT JOIN
     * does exactly that, and a missing marker (never opened) correctly counts everything.
     * <p>
     * Asking per athlete instead would cost 1 + 4N queries — 61 on a roster of fifteen.
