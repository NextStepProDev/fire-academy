/**
 * The client's training statistics.
 *
 * <h2>Deliberately not cached</h2>
 * Undoing a completion, deleting a training or back-dating one all have to move the numbers
 * immediately — a coach who unticks a session and still sees it counted stops trusting the panel.
 * The cost is two indexed queries plus one in-memory pass, which is cheap enough that a cache would
 * only buy staleness.
 *
 * <p>All arithmetic lives in {@link TrainingStatsCalculator}, which takes "today" as an argument so
 * every window can be tested against a fixed date.
