/**
 * Renders a comment for one particular viewer.
 * <p>
 * Two services build this shape — {@link PersonalTrainingService} for the thread and plain text
 * replies, {@link TrainingPhotoService} for replies carrying a photo — and both must produce
 * byte-identical payloads, because a single frontend component renders whatever comes back. Hence
 * one mapper rather than a copy on each side.
 * <p>
 * The viewer is a parameter, not an afterthought: the photo URL points at the coach's endpoint or
 * the client's depending on who asked, and {@code canDelete} is a statement about this reader.
