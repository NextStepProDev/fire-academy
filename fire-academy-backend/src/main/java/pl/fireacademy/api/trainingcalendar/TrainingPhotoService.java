 * <p>

 * for the coach and the client, so both must get an identical payload. Which athlete a caller may
 * reach is settled by {@link TrainingAccessService}, exactly as everywhere else in this package —
 * meaning a stranger gets 404 rather than 403, and the client's own path is additionally gated by
 * {@code TrainingConsentInterceptor} because it lives under {@code /api/user/my-training}.
 * <p>
 * These files are health data (GDPR art. 9). They never enter the public {@code /api/files}
 * namespace and are never cached to disk anywhere — see the headers in the controllers.
