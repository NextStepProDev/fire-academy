/**
 * Everything that can be "new" on a training calendar, in one place.
 * <p>
 * The complete list was settled before the first counter was written, because the failure mode is
 * silent: a source nobody remembered simply never lights a dot, and the gap only surfaces when
 * someone complains that a change went unnoticed.
 *
 * <p><b>News for the client (from the coach):</b>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>a training the coach created or edited</li>
 *   <li>a comment written by the coach</li>
 *   <li>a future training the coach deleted</li>
 *   <li>a goal the coach set — the one source with no counterpart below</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>News for the coach (from the client):</b>
 * <ol start="5">
 *   <li>a training the client created or edited — this covers ticking off AND undoing it</li>
 *   <li>a comment written by the client</li>
 *   <li>a future training the client deleted</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Symmetry is the point for the six that pair up: both directions are computed by the same code
 * with the role flag flipped, so a rule cannot be enforced one way and forgotten the other. Goals
 * are the deliberate exception, and the code says so at the point where it breaks the symmetry.
 *
 * <p><b>Being caught up has two edges.</b> "As of when" is not enough on its own: the calendar is
 * read one page at a time, so opening this week said nothing about next month — yet it used to stamp
 * the whole plan as seen. The marker therefore also carries how far the viewer got, and a source is
 * unread when the other side touched it after the last visit OR when it sits past that day.
 * Deletions are the exception: they arrive through the banner, which is not bounded by the page.
