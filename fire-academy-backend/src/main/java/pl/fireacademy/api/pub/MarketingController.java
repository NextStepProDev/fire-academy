     * then POST to the address in them by themselves. That request looks nothing like the one the SPA sends:
     * no JavaScript runs, so the token has to travel <strong>in the URL</strong> — the mailbox has nowhere to
     * get a JSON body from — and the body it does send is the fixed form field
     * {@code List-Unsubscribe=One-Click}.
     *
     * <p>Matched on the presence of {@code token} alone, deliberately without a {@code consumes} condition.
     * Pinning it to {@code application/x-www-form-urlencoded} would send any provider that omits or varies
     * the content type to the JSON handler above, which answers 415 — so nobody gets unsubscribed and the
     * provider records a failed unsubscribe. A mailbox trying to unsubscribe somebody must never be answered
     * with an error. The SPA is unaffected: it sends no {@code token} parameter, so it still lands above.
     *
     * <p>This is one operation with two ways in, not a second implementation — both call the same service
     * method, so the rules about consent, idempotency and not leaking whether an account exists hold once.
