/**
 * Keeps the null-safety declaration on every package, not just the ones somebody remembered.
 * <p>
 * {@code @NullMarked} is what turns an unannotated type into "this is never null". Without it a type
 * has <em>unspecified</em> nullness — so a {@code @Nullable} standing next to unmarked neighbours
 * reads like a full contract while carrying half of one, and nothing anywhere says so. JSpecify is
 * explicit that the marker does not reach downwards: <em>"This annotation has no effect on
 * subpackages."</em> One declaration at the root therefore covers the root and nothing else, which
 * is exactly the state this gate was written to end.
 * <p>
 * There is no compiler error to lean on here and no runtime symptom either, which is why the rule is
 * checked against the source tree instead. Adding a package is the moment the convention is silently
 * dropped, and a new package is added without thinking about nullness roughly every time.
