/**
 * Reads our own source and refuses one specific mistake: a scheduler holding transactional work that
 * only it can reach.
 * <p>
 * {@code @Transactional} is applied by a proxy wrapped around the bean. A call arriving from outside
 * passes through it; a call from a sibling method inside the same object does not, and the
 * annotation then does nothing at all — no error, no warning, no visible change, because every
 * repository call opens a transaction of its own and the work still completes. Only the atomicity of
 * the batch quietly disappears.
 * <p>
 * That combination is why this gate reads source instead of behaviour. A normal test of a scheduler
 * injects the bean and calls it, which is entry through the proxy — the one path where the
 * annotation works. Production takes the other one. The bug shipped once exactly like that, past a
 * review and a green suite, and nothing about the running system would ever have said so.
 * <p>
 * The rule is narrow on purpose. Self-invocation of a transactional method is perfectly correct when
 * the caller is itself transactional, and this codebase does it in eight places that are all fine;
 * a gate flagging those would cry wolf on the first day and be muted by the end of the week.
