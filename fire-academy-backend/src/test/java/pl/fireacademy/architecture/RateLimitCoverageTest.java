/**
 * Every controller base path must land in a rate-limit bucket, and land in the same one whether it
 * is called on the bare base or on a sub-path.
 *
 * <p>Both halves come from the same failure mode. A rule written as {@code startsWith("/api/x/")}
 * covers a feature to the eye, but misses any endpoint mapped on the bare base — it carries no
 * trailing slash. In the sibling climbing app that is exactly how the heaviest query in the
 * application ran unthrottled for months: nothing about the rule looked wrong, you had to hold the
 * URI shape and the prefix in your head at the same time to see it. Fire Academy has no such
 * endpoint today, which is precisely why the trap is worth closing now rather than after one appears.
 *
 * <p>The filter denies by default, so a forgotten controller falls into the generic bucket instead
 * of through the filter untouched. This gate is what turns "it gets some limit" into "somebody chose
 * its limit": a new base path nobody thought about shows up here as the generic bucket at the moment
 * it is added, rather than in an audit two years later.
