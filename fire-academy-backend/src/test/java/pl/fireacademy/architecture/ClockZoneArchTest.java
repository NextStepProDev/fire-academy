/**
 * The clock the money is counted in.
 *
 * <p>Monthly billing, payment windows, proration, refunds, "today" and every session date are derived
 * from the JVM's default zone. Not one of those call sites passes a {@link ZoneId} — there is no
 * {@code ZoneId.of(...)} anywhere in the production sources — so the whole of it rests on the default
 * being Europe/Warsaw. That makes the zone a load-bearing setting with no code to defend it, which is
 * exactly the shape of thing that disappears in a refactor and is noticed a month later, around
 * midnight on the first of the month.
 *
 * <p>Two ends, because there are two ways to lose it and they fail differently:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>tests</b> — before this was pinned in build.gradle the suite ran in the host's zone:
 *       Europe/Warsaw locally, UTC on CI. Green meant "agreed with whatever clock happened to be
 *       running", not "agreed with production";
 *   <li><b>production</b> — the Dockerfile's {@code -Duser.timezone} is the only thing setting it
 *       there. Drop that flag and the container silently falls back to UTC, and every bill computed
 *       within two hours of midnight lands in the wrong month.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>docker-compose.prod.yml also sets a TZ variable, but that is documented as redundant belt and
 * braces — it only covers OS-level timestamps and does nothing for a container started without
 * compose, which is precisely the case the Dockerfile default exists to cover.
