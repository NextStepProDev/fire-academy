/**
 * The owner's private notes must be unreachable from anywhere that is not the notebook itself.
 *
 * <p>The danger this guards against is not a missing role check. It is an obliging field. The shapes
 * that describe a session are shared: {@code CalendarRangeResponse} is ONE record served both to the
 * coach and to the client, and the public listings are cached at the edge. A note field added to any
 * of them compiles, reads like a convenience, and publishes the notebook to the exact people it is
 * written about. A service that cannot read a note cannot leak one, so the fence is structural and
 * privacy stops depending on anyone remembering.
 *
 * <h2>Why the matching is shaped like this</h2>
 * The sibling app shipped this gate checking for the fully-qualified name and for the type name
 * followed by a space. That missed {@code import ...domain.adminnote.*;}, it missed
 * {@code AdminPrivateNote.SOME_CONSTANT}, and it missed {@code List<AdminPrivateNote>} -- after the
 * name comes a dot or an angle bracket, not a space. Worse, a wildcard import of one's own domain
 * package turned out to be that repo's house style, so the bypass was the local convention rather
 * than an exotic move. It is the house style HERE too: 66 files use wildcard imports and nine
 * services wildcard-import their own domain package ({@code PersonalTrainingService},
 * {@code AttachmentService}, {@code TrainingUnreadService}, {@code TrainingStatsService},
 * {@code AdminEventService}, {@code AdminEventTypeService}, {@code PublicService} and two more).
 *
 * <p>So this gate measures "does this code reach a note", not "does this file contain that string":
 * word boundaries around the type names, plus the package name, which catches the fully-qualified
 * use and the star import alike.
