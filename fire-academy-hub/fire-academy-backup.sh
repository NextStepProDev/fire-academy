# Nightly backup: the whole database, the uploads volume, encrypted off-site.
#
# Runs from root's crontab at 03:00 — see the install note at the bottom of this file. It used to
# live only on the production box, which meant a rebuild of that box lost it: the one file in the
# backup system that had no backup. It ships from the repo now, the same way nginx.conf and
# setup-swap.sh do.
#
# Three rules this script exists to keep, each one learned the hard way somewhere:
#
#   1. NEVER let the off-site copy mirror deletions. `rclone sync` makes the destination identical
#      to the source, deletions included — so anything that wipes /backups here (a bad disk, a
#      stray rm, ransomware) reaches Google Drive on the next run, and a mistake nobody notices for
#      a week is unrecoverable because the copies from before it were pruned. `copy` only ever adds;
#      the remote is pruned separately and far more slowly.
#   2. NEVER publish a dump that did not finish. The shell creates the output file before pg_dump
#      writes a byte, so an interrupted dump leaves something that looks exactly like a backup — and
#      a truncated dump is usually still a VALID gzip, so testing the compression proves nothing.
#      Work goes to a .part file, is checked for pg_dump's own end marker, and only then takes the
#      real name.
#   3. NEVER rely on being told about failure. Cron mails root, root's mail goes nowhere on a cloud
#      box, and `set -e` exits in silence. A backup that stopped running in March is discovered in
#      August. The ping below inverts that: an external service expects to hear from us daily and
#      raises the alarm when it does not — which also covers the cases no failure mail could ever
#      report, like the machine being off or the cron entry being gone.

# How long copies live. Local is short because it is only a staging area and shares the disk with
# the database; off-site is longer because that is the copy you reach for when you discover a problem
# late, and "late" is the whole reason it exists. 40 days, not 90: the Google Drive account (15 GB) is

# The uploads archive is only made when the uploads changed. Every archive is a complete copy, so a

# training photos (uploads/trainingphotos, same volume) can arrive any day and expire after 30 days
# (TrainingPhotoRetentionScheduler), so every upload or expiry means a new archive — how many
# nights stay unchanged is not measured yet; the log says so on each run. The rule is kept the
# same as in climbing and anovastudio, whose uploads change less often. Each archive is still
# FULL, never incremental: a restore is the newest dump plus the newest uploads archive dated on or
# before it — no newer archive means precisely that nothing changed.
#
# The state file holds a fingerprint of the volume (path, size and mtime of every file). Even with no
# change an archive is made every FILES_REFRESH_DAYS days, which must stay below
