/**
 * Google sign-in.
 *
 * The backend half exists (OAuth2 user service, success handler, the consent screen at
 * `/uzupelnij-profil`) and is covered by tests, but production runs without the `oauth2` profile and
 * without Google credentials — so `/oauth2/authorization/google` answers 401 there. The button was
 * never gated behind anything, which meant a live sign-in page offering a door that opened onto an
 * error. This flag is that gate, and it also drives the "not yet active" markers in the privacy
 * policy, so the page and the promise can never disagree.
 *
 * TO SWITCH IT ON — in this order, or the backend will not start:
 *   1. Create OAuth credentials in the Google Cloud console and register the redirect address
 *      `https://fireworkout.pl/login/oauth2/code/google`.
 *   2. Put `OAUTH2_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH2_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in the production `.env`.
 *      The `oauth2` profile resolves both without a default, so enabling the profile while they are
 *      missing takes the whole application down, not just the login.
 *   3. Only then set `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod,oauth2`.
 *   4. Close the two audit findings that sit on this exact path first: nginx has to send
 *      `X-Forwarded-Host` of its own (otherwise the callback address can be bent by a request
 *      header), and the tokens should stop travelling in the query string.
 *   5. Flip this to `true` and bump `LAST_UPDATED` in `PrivacyPolicyPage` — the policy already
 *      describes the feature in full, and the flag is what removes the "w przygotowaniu" markers.
